### a.k.a [__Tinder for Cats__](https://whiskr-maiqvu.herokuapp.com)  ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ

Because it's impurrrtant for you and your kitty to look at hot kitties nearby!

## User story

* A cat can sign up for an account and browse other cats' profiles on the dashboard.
* When you find a hottie, click on the 'heart' button to express your like.
* If the other user at some point also likes you back, then it's a match!
* Congratulations! You two have unlocked a secret portal to message each other. Commence quietly sliding into their DM...
* A user can also go to their profile page to upload more photos and create their own gallery on Whiskr (the moar the better, because who wouldn't want to look at your purrrettay face?!).

In addition to the default gems that come with a Rails project template, I have added pry-rails, pry-byebug, cloudinary, and geocoder. See Gemfile for more details. Before starting up the server, please run `bundle` in your terminal.

## Future improvements

Due to time limit, I couldn't implement everything I have planned out. Much heartbroken many upset ✧/ᐠ-ꞈ-ᐟ\  

In the future I plan to improve Whiskr with these features:

- [ ] Change the color scheme and add more UI styling
- [ ] Display a user's photo gallery in Instagram-like carousel style
- [ ] Implement touch-enabled Tinder-like swiping gestures
- [ ] Real-time chat
- [ ] Use geolocation to suggest kitties on the dashboard
